# ExpertSystem
The expert system knows the coordinates of the machine and the target coordinates, the machine has three sensors, they operate at a limited distance. When the sensor crosses the object, the machine receives information about the distance to the obstacle. This information is transferred to the expert system. With the help of this information, the expert system finds its way to the goal.

There is a set of example levels. In each of them you can move the target (click the "EndPoint" button and then click at any place) or the machine (click the "StartPoint" button and then click at any place).

You should set the speed in x2 or x3 at the bottom of the screen.

8th level has first-person camera.
